# MachineLearningAtScale-FinalProject
Final Project for Spark/Machine Learning Class - Assignment Description Below


Overview Throughout this course you’ve engaged with key principles required to develop scalable machine learning analyses for structured and unstructured data. Working in Hadoop Streaming and Spark you’ve learned to translate common machine learning algorithms into Map-Reduce style implementations. You’ve developed the ability to evaluate Machine Learning approaches both in terms of their predictive performance as well as their scalability. For the final project you will demonstrate these skills by solving a machine learning challenge on a new dataset. Your job is to perform Click Through Rate prediction on a large dataset of Criteo advertising data made public as part of a Kaggle competition a few years back. As you perform your analysis, keep in mind that we are not grading you on the final performance of your model or how ‘advanced’ the techniques you use but rather on your ability to explain and develop a scalable machine learning approach to answering a real question.  

Deliverable 
You will have 4 weeks to work with your team to develop your analysis. Your submission summarizing and presenting your work will be a Jupyter notebook with the following 5 sections:  
** 1. Question Formulation 
Introduce the goal of your analysis. What questions will you seek to answer, why do people perform this kind of analysis on this kind of data? Preview what level of performance your model would need to achieve to be practically useful.  

** 2. Algorithm Explanation
Create your own toy example that matches the dataset provided and use this toy example to explain the math behind the algorithm that you will perform. 

** 3. EDA & Discussion of Challenges
Determine 2-3 relevant EDA tasks that will help you make decisions about how you implement the algorithm to be scalable. Discuss any challenges that you anticipate based on the EDA you perform. 

** 4. Algorithm Implementation
Develop a ‘homegrown’ implementation of the algorithm, apply it to the training dataset and evaluate your results on the test set.  

** 5. Application of Course Concepts
Pick 3-5 key course concepts and discuss how your work on this assignment illustrates an understanding of these concepts.
